# UFOs
## Project Overview
In this repository, we will use Javascript to create a table that organizes UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

## Results
The webpage created is a display of UFO sighting data with a filter table that allows users to easily filter on various criteria such as date, city, state, and shape of the UFO sighting. An unfiltered view can be seen below:

The tables update in real time so there is no need to refresh. Filter selection can be broad such as only selecting a country and state like the United States and New York as shown below:

To narrow the results, you could add in the shape or date filter:
