# UFOs
## Project Overview
In this repository, we will use Javascript to create a table that organizes UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

## Results
The webpage created is a fairly user-friendly display of ufo sighting data with a filter table that allows users to easily filter on various criteria such as date, city, state, and shape of the UFO sighting. A global unfiltered view can be seen below.
